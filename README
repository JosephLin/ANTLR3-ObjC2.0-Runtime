ANTLR version 3 supports target language generation for the lexical
analyzer and parsers. Objective C was supported previously but had not
been brought up to date for some time. This release is built on the work
by Kay Roepke, Ian Michell and Alan Condit.

The project is currently working sufficiently for me to use it in compiling
my grammar and tree walker. I am sure that it still has some bugs but I have
fixed all of the bugs that I have found so far.

The project consists of an Objective-C runtime framework that must be
installed in /Library/Frameworks.

It also requires the installation of the String Template files to
support the target language code generation. Hopefully, at some point
they will be incorporated into the ANTLR release code, so that the
individual user doesn't have to do anything but load the framework into
the proper location. However, for now you need to create an ObjC
directory in antlr-3.2/tool/src/main/resources/org/antlr/codegen/templates
and then copy the ObjC ".stg" files to
antlr-3.2/tool/src/main/resources/org/antlr/codegen/templates/ObjC/*.

There is also a java file ObjCTarget.java that goes in <
antlr-3.2/tool/src/main/java/org/antlr/codegen/ObjCTarget/Java>.

If you are using Antlr3.4 the code from here is included with the Antlr tarball. You just need
to copy the ANTLR.framework to /Library/Frameworks.
The Objective-C target for ANTLR3.4 is still a work in progress.
Something in the addition of ST4 to ANTLR3.4 has broken the ObjC.stg file.
It generates code but some of the code is definitely incorrect.

If you replace the templates in the pre-release jar the code generates correctly
but if you put the same templates in the latest jar it generates code incorrectly.
